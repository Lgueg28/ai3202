# Assignment 3
###### A * path finding algorithms in python
## Heuristic Chosen
###### Euclidian
I choose the euclidian heuristic which is a more direct way to estimate the distance from your current position to the goal

Equation : a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (pythagorean theorem) then take square root of c^2 and c is the estimation from the goal
